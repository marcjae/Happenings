####Happenings shows you the most recent photos from Instagram given the lat long of an 'onclick' event.

#### Issues:
* ~~First click does not load photos. Must click map twice.~~
* ~~onClick does not reset with new lat long.~~
* ~~API does not load often.  Looking into removing jquery.instagram.js~~

#### To-do:
* ~~Get image title below images~~
* Light box for photos onClick
* ~~Looking to bring in Foursquare 'swarming' data~~
* ~~Only load 1 photo or better layour for loading many photos~~
* Update the design and general layout
* ~~Get rid of jquery.instagram.js and use own AJAX request~~
